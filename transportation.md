California is notorious for having some of the longest commutes in America, but the Policy Club is focused on how Californians will get around tomorrow. We believe the future will include shorter commutes through a combination of public transit, bicycling and walking. Our work in the coming months will revolve around making smart investments and implementing common-sense solutions that address the Stateâ€™s current challenges with an eye on where California is headed in the future.

The Policy Club will analyze:

* Methods of reducing congestion in the most congested areas of the State primarily focused on Los Angeles County and the Bay Area.

* Ways to better leverage Transportation Network Companies such as Uber and Lyft to improve current investments in public transit by minimizing last mile/first mile.

* How to improve zoning and planning to develop near existing and future public transit.
